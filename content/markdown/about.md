### It has always been Filecoin's mission to serve as the foundation for humanity's information.

The Filecoin Dataset explorer takes the data stored from initiatives like Space Race 2: Slingshot and other sources and presents them in a unified interface. A variety of data is stored on Filecoin, including telemetry and imaging, historical archives, Creative Commons-licensed media, entertainment archives, scientific research papers, machine learning training sets and more. These important datasets are accessible and explorable by anyone in the world. 

Filecoin is particularly suited for storing especially large datasets in a redundant fashion. This means that in many cases, the same dataset files will be available from different Storage Providers in different places around the world. Each 32 GiB part of a dataset is represented by a unique CID: a unique identifier for each collection of files stored. <a href=""#>Click here to learn so much more about the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious content</a>
