### Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to store humanity's most important information

The Dataset Explorer takes data stored through initiatives like [Slingshot](https://slingshot.filecoin.io) and other sources and presents them in a unified interface. A variety of data is stored on Filecoin, including telemetry and imaging, historical archives, Creative Commons-licensed media, entertainment archives, scientific research papers, machine learning training sets, and more. These datasets are accessible to anyone in the world. 

Filecoin is particularly suited for storing especially large datasets in a redundant fashion. This means that in many cases, the same dataset files will be available from different Storage Providers in different places around the world. Each part (up to 32 GiB) of a dataset is represented by a unique content identifier (CID).
