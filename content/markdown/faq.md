Filecoin is particularly suited for storing large-scale datasets, although some smaller datasets can be found here as well. A broad variety of data is â€‹accessible via this site. This includes telemetry and imaging, historical archives, Creative Commons-licensed media, entertainment archives, scientific research papers, machine learning training sets and more.

The datasets are updated in real time, as on-chain deals are made on the Filecoin mainnet. You may see a 10 minute discrepancy between when a deal on the chain becomes sealed and active, and when it's visible on this site.

At the moment, retrievals must be done via [lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io/) or other Filecoin tools like Powergate. Once you've found a file you'd like to download, click the code icon to generate a lotus command for its retrieval. Additionally, we're currently working on other retrieval methods that will require less tooling and overhead.

Browse a dataset or search files by filename in the search bar on any dataset's page. We're also working on building indices of datasets. These will give you the ability to see a tree of files located within each 32 GiB container, which will be especially useful for larger datasets containing numerous smaller files.

"Yes, absolutely. Propose new datasets by [creating an issue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/issues/new/choose) on Github. This is currently done under the Slingshot program.
