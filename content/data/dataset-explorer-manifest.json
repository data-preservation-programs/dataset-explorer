Impressive progress has been made with both geometric-based methods and learning-based methods. However, developing robust and reliable SLAM methods for real-world applications is still a challenging problem. Real-life environments are full of difficult cases such as light changes or lack of illumination, dynamic objects, and texture-less scenes. This dataset takes advantages of the advancing computer graphics technology, and aims to cover diverse scenarios with challenging features in simulation."
